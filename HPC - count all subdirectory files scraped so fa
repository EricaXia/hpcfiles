# HPC - count all subdirectory files scraped so far

find . -name "*_UTC.json" | wc -l

## go into every subdirectory, count how many "*_UTC.json" files in total:
find -maxdepth 1 -type d | while read -r dir; do printf "%s:\t" "$dir"; find "$dir" -name "*_UTC.json" -type f | wc -l; done

# count files in total:
find -maxdepth 1 -type d | while read -r dir; do printf "%s:\t" "$dir"; find "$dir" -type f | wc -l; done


Part 1. finds all directories in current folder
2. Begin while loop ("while" the list of directories is continuing to be sent, do this..)
3. Print each directory name followed by tab
4. Make a list of all files in curr subdir
5. Counts number of lines in that list


Running count, 4/4/20:
